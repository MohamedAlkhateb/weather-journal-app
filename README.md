# weather-journal-app

This is the second project for Udacity Front End Web Development Professional Nanodegree Program.

The project has a starter code. Most of my code is javascript code that is in `server.js`, and `app.js` files.

# Project Objective

This project is about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

# Usage

1. Make sure that you installed Node.
2. Start your server by running `node server.js` in your terminal.

# Dependencies

- `express`
- `body-parser`
